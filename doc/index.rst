Ceph uniquely delivers **object, block, and file storage in one unified
system**. Ceph is highly reliable, easy to manage, and free. The power of Ceph
can transform your companyâ€™s IT infrastructure and your ability to manage vast
amounts of data. Ceph delivers extraordinary scalability--thousands of clients
accessing petabytes to exabytes of data. Ceph leverages commodity hardware and
intelligent daemons to accommodate large numbers of storage hosts, which
communicate with each other to replicate data, and redistribute data
dynamically. Ceph's cluster of monitors oversees the hosts in the Ceph storage
cluster to ensure that the storage hosts are running smoothly.
